# LSDE-Reddit-Ukraine-War
The course project of Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam Large Scale Data Engineering 2022. 

We conducted data cleaning, key-word extraction, topic analysis, sentiment analysis and political standpoint classification based on all posts and comments data from Reddit.

We explored reddit data and keep the data we care about. After comparing Yake and BM25, we choose Yake to  filter the topic to get posts about the Ukraine war. We manually label over 3500 data and construct two pipelines to complete sentiment analysis and political standpoint analysis respectively. We count the number and sentiment of submissions and comments at different times. We also count the number of di erent standpoints and their changes over timeand get word clouds. We  nd the posters and subreddits that generate the most relevant discussions.
